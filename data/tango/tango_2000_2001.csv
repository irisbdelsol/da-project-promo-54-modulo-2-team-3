Quique Sinesi,tango,track,The Lady,2001,5wE5GdOef8jsaAuILehOpz,"Quique Sinesi ; (キケ・シネーシ) Quique Sinesi (b. March 13, 1960) is a Latin Grammy Award-winning, Argentinian guitarist. He has performed with artists such as Joe Lovano, Dino Saluzzi, Pablo Ziegler, Enrico Rava, and Charlie Mariano. 引用元：http://www.geocities.jp/musica_arbrfr/quiquesinesi.html キケ・シネシ。1960年、ブエノスアイレスに生まれる。幼少よりクラシック、ジャズギター、作編曲の教育をうけ、プロとしてのキャリアは1974年、キケが14歳のと時からというから早熟な天才だったのだろう。Pedro Aznar、Ruben Rada、Lito EpumerやMono Fontanaらとセッションを繰り返していたらしい。1982年にバンドネオン奏者Dino Saluziのカルテット一員としてヨーロッパツアーに同行。キケにとっての初ヨーロッパツアーとなった。1984年にAlfombra MagicaをMatias Gonzales、Horacio Lopesと結成し3枚のアルバムを録音した。そして1986年ピアソラバンドのピアニストだったPablo Zieglerのカルテットに参加。またデンマークのトロンボーン奏者Erling Kronerのアルバムの録音にも参加している。1992年Dino Saluziの2回目のヨーロッパツアーに同行、またPablo Zieglerの北中南米ツアー、ヨーロッパツアーに同行するなど、世界をまたに活動をするようになった。 1989年キケのファーストアルバム”Cielo Abierto”を発表（1996年にMelopeaよりCDリリース）。Alfombra Magicaのメンバー、Cesar Franov、Alejandro Franpvらが参加している。“Cielo Abierto”、「Open Sky」。杉林から舞い降りる木漏れ陽、覗かれる白い空。ジャズ、ロック、クラシック、フォルクローレそのどれでもない、そこに差し込む陽の光のように、照らすことによりその時その場所にしかないものを呼び覚ますキケのギター。その名に相応しく“Cielo Abierto”はキケの代表曲となった。 その後、アルゼンチン、チリでの国際的ギターフェスティバルに参加、ヨーロッパ、アルゼンチンでジャンルを問わず様々なアーティスト達と活動を続け、1998年にアルゼンチンのEpsaレーベル世界にギタリストシリーズとして、セカンドアルバム”Danza sin fin”（Endless Dance）をリリース。同年Epsaよりクラリネット奏者Marcelo Moguilevskyとのデュオアルバム”Soltando Amarras”（Free from Bounds）をリリース。 2000年にはドイツのレーベルから立て続けに新作をリリース。ケルンのVelve-HeartsよりピアニストPablo Paredes、チリ人フォルクローレミュージシャンSergio Teranとのアルバム”Viaje Latinoamericano”をリリース。ECMがフォルクローレ音楽を取り上げたらこんなアルバムになるのでは、という感じの美しい音楽になっている。 そしてインディペンデントレーベルGenuit Musikよりサードアルバム”Color Cielo”（Color of Sky）をリリース。絵を描くように、本を書くように作ったというこのアルバム。Charlie Mariano、Markus Stockhausen、Mitchel Forman という変わった面子が参加。ヨーロッパで、ヨーロッパのミュージシャンとキケのアルゼンチンへの思いをこめたアルバムだ。ヨーロッパにおけるキケの活動の一先ずの集成といっていいだろう。 そして2001年には、4thアルバム”Microtangos”をドイツのAcoustic Music Recordsよりリリース。ジャズミュージシャンとの共演の多かったキケが、改めてソロギタリストとしての自分をアピールしたアルバムだ。1曲目はあのCielo Albierto。キケを初めて聴く人にはまずこれをすすめたい。 EnjaレーベルからCharlie Marianoとのデュオ”Tango para Charlie”がリリース。 また、ドイツ在住のアルゼンチン人パーカッション奏者Daniel Messinaとのデュオアルバム”Prioridad a la emocion”をDanielの個人レーベル”art-mode-records”よりリリース。DanielはBarbara Dennerleinと活動している人物だ。面白いことに、キケはこのアルバムの製作理由を二人のスピネッタへのリスペクトより生まれたという。 2003年にリリースされたアルゼンチンのシンガーSilvia Iriondoの3rd”Tierra que anda”でもキケの素晴らしい演奏が聴くことができる（1st、2ndにも参加している）。 EnjaからはPablo ZieglerとのNew Tango Duo”Bajo Cero”をリリース。”Bajo Cero”と、前述のCharlie Marianoとのデュオ”Tango para Charlie”は国内盤もリリースされた！Pablo Zieglerとは韓国までツアーできたというのに日本へは来ず！なぜ？!おかしすぎるよ。 他にも参加作品は数多いが、代表作はこんなところだろうか。 キケのギターの音は彼のアルバムタイトルで語られている。“Cielo Abierto”、 ”Danza sin fin”、そして”Color Cielo”。空に浮かび輝く終わりのないダンス。それは光をまとい、風を友とし、雲と戯れる、静かで優雅なダンス。 何時の日か、そのダンスを目の前で、そしてともに踊れる日を、木漏れ陽の向こうに想う <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Quique+Sinesi"">Read more on Last.fm</a>",7117,52814,Carlos Moscardini,Hector Ayala,Puente Celeste

Quique Sinesi,tango,album,Tango Para Charlie,2001,2WZMLXFx2eUMggcs5SIMAr,"Quique Sinesi ; (キケ・シネーシ) Quique Sinesi (b. March 13, 1960) is a Latin Grammy Award-winning, Argentinian guitarist. He has performed with artists such as Joe Lovano, Dino Saluzzi, Pablo Ziegler, Enrico Rava, and Charlie Mariano. 引用元：http://www.geocities.jp/musica_arbrfr/quiquesinesi.html キケ・シネシ。1960年、ブエノスアイレスに生まれる。幼少よりクラシック、ジャズギター、作編曲の教育をうけ、プロとしてのキャリアは1974年、キケが14歳のと時からというから早熟な天才だったのだろう。Pedro Aznar、Ruben Rada、Lito EpumerやMono Fontanaらとセッションを繰り返していたらしい。1982年にバンドネオン奏者Dino Saluziのカルテット一員としてヨーロッパツアーに同行。キケにとっての初ヨーロッパツアーとなった。1984年にAlfombra MagicaをMatias Gonzales、Horacio Lopesと結成し3枚のアルバムを録音した。そして1986年ピアソラバンドのピアニストだったPablo Zieglerのカルテットに参加。またデンマークのトロンボーン奏者Erling Kronerのアルバムの録音にも参加している。1992年Dino Saluziの2回目のヨーロッパツアーに同行、またPablo Zieglerの北中南米ツアー、ヨーロッパツアーに同行するなど、世界をまたに活動をするようになった。 1989年キケのファーストアルバム”Cielo Abierto”を発表（1996年にMelopeaよりCDリリース）。Alfombra Magicaのメンバー、Cesar Franov、Alejandro Franpvらが参加している。“Cielo Abierto”、「Open Sky」。杉林から舞い降りる木漏れ陽、覗かれる白い空。ジャズ、ロック、クラシック、フォルクローレそのどれでもない、そこに差し込む陽の光のように、照らすことによりその時その場所にしかないものを呼び覚ますキケのギター。その名に相応しく“Cielo Abierto”はキケの代表曲となった。 その後、アルゼンチン、チリでの国際的ギターフェスティバルに参加、ヨーロッパ、アルゼンチンでジャンルを問わず様々なアーティスト達と活動を続け、1998年にアルゼンチンのEpsaレーベル世界にギタリストシリーズとして、セカンドアルバム”Danza sin fin”（Endless Dance）をリリース。同年Epsaよりクラリネット奏者Marcelo Moguilevskyとのデュオアルバム”Soltando Amarras”（Free from Bounds）をリリース。 2000年にはドイツのレーベルから立て続けに新作をリリース。ケルンのVelve-HeartsよりピアニストPablo Paredes、チリ人フォルクローレミュージシャンSergio Teranとのアルバム”Viaje Latinoamericano”をリリース。ECMがフォルクローレ音楽を取り上げたらこんなアルバムになるのでは、という感じの美しい音楽になっている。 そしてインディペンデントレーベルGenuit Musikよりサードアルバム”Color Cielo”（Color of Sky）をリリース。絵を描くように、本を書くように作ったというこのアルバム。Charlie Mariano、Markus Stockhausen、Mitchel Forman という変わった面子が参加。ヨーロッパで、ヨーロッパのミュージシャンとキケのアルゼンチンへの思いをこめたアルバムだ。ヨーロッパにおけるキケの活動の一先ずの集成といっていいだろう。 そして2001年には、4thアルバム”Microtangos”をドイツのAcoustic Music Recordsよりリリース。ジャズミュージシャンとの共演の多かったキケが、改めてソロギタリストとしての自分をアピールしたアルバムだ。1曲目はあのCielo Albierto。キケを初めて聴く人にはまずこれをすすめたい。 EnjaレーベルからCharlie Marianoとのデュオ”Tango para Charlie”がリリース。 また、ドイツ在住のアルゼンチン人パーカッション奏者Daniel Messinaとのデュオアルバム”Prioridad a la emocion”をDanielの個人レーベル”art-mode-records”よりリリース。DanielはBarbara Dennerleinと活動している人物だ。面白いことに、キケはこのアルバムの製作理由を二人のスピネッタへのリスペクトより生まれたという。 2003年にリリースされたアルゼンチンのシンガーSilvia Iriondoの3rd”Tierra que anda”でもキケの素晴らしい演奏が聴くことができる（1st、2ndにも参加している）。 EnjaからはPablo ZieglerとのNew Tango Duo”Bajo Cero”をリリース。”Bajo Cero”と、前述のCharlie Marianoとのデュオ”Tango para Charlie”は国内盤もリリースされた！Pablo Zieglerとは韓国までツアーできたというのに日本へは来ず！なぜ？!おかしすぎるよ。 他にも参加作品は数多いが、代表作はこんなところだろうか。 キケのギターの音は彼のアルバムタイトルで語られている。“Cielo Abierto”、 ”Danza sin fin”、そして”Color Cielo”。空に浮かび輝く終わりのないダンス。それは光をまとい、風を友とし、雲と戯れる、静かで優雅なダンス。 何時の日か、そのダンスを目の前で、そしてともに踊れる日を、木漏れ陽の向こうに想う <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Quique+Sinesi"">Read more on Last.fm</a>",7117,52814,Carlos Moscardini,Hector Ayala,Puente Celeste
